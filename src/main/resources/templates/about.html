<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Morgan Alexandra Miller is a Senior Information Systems Major from Plainfield, New Jersey. Graduating high school at just 16 years old, Morgan knew she would have a lot to prove. Throughout her matriculation, Morgan has become a Howard University Campus Pal, served as a Team Leader for the 21st Century Advantage Program, joined the School of Business honors program, served as the Director of Fundraising for student council, currently serves as the 2018-2019 Miss Omega Psi Phi, and was recently inducted into Beta Gamma Sigma International Honor Society all while maintaining a 3.84 grade point average. These past two summers Morgan has interned with one of the big four accounting firms, PricewaterhouseCoopers, in their New York city office, and this summer, she went on to explore commercial banking with Capital One. Morgan tends to either be spending her time working on some form of creative project – whether it be graphic design, drawing, or painting – or making memories with her friends and family.
